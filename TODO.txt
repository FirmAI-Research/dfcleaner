rewrite test cases with a seprate dataframe for each test

change_dtypes from float to int doesn't work

drop column if too many missing values

One-hot encode categorical columns

scale and normalize the data in dfcleaner

maybe add train test split functionality

add logging functionality to generate log files that
stores the line changes and the function that changed them. 
Just like git diff.

(multi-column method)
to fill nan, predict from a linear regression model where
y is the nan column (column to predict) and x is the column
that is most correlated to y.

(single-column method)
to fill nan, sample from the column
