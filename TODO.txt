scale and normalize the data in dfcleaner

maybe add train test split functionality

determine which columns need to change their dtype from 
string to float by picking 10 random samples from that
column and trying to parse it as float (float(value)).
If the majority of them get converted to float then the 
dtype may be converted to float.
eg: a numeric column might have a '?' instead of np.nan

determine categorical and continuous columns by
looking at column names with their count
of unique values in descending order.
