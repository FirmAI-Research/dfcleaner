initialize the required test variables inside their respective
methods and not in a huge lump inside the setUp() method.

rearrange the arguments in all functions

drop column if too many missing values

One-hot encode categorical columns

scale and normalize the data in dfcleaner

maybe add train test split functionality

(multi-column method)
to fill nan, predict from a linear regression model where
y is the nan column (column to predict) and x is the column

(single-column method)
to fill nan, sample from the column
